# Compatibility

Nevolution should work on any AOSP-compatible Android devices.

* If it could not be activated successfully...

  Try enabling **auto-run (auto-start or similar feature)** for Nevolution. These settings are usually located in system Settings - Apps (or Battery, Performance, Optimization)

* If it stopped working after a while...

  Try excluding Nevolution from any battery-saving features, which may blindly kill Nevolution in background.

  Although Nevolution must be kept in the background all the time, it is actually sleeping with no battery consumption except for the second upon notification arrival. If used properly, there's no perceivable overall increment of battery consumption due to its passive working nature.

* 如果你的设备运行的是 MIUI 中国版

  请在系统设置中为 女娲石 开启「自启动」，并在省电优化中选择「无限制」。

  为获得更佳的视觉体验，请在系统设置中修改通知样式为「原生样式」。

  MIUI 9 由于缺少 Android 标准通知栏的一些特性（例如 快捷回复），女娲石及其插件的部分功能可能无法使用。

If you found other compatibility issue, please open an issue to report.
